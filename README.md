# Turbo-Tunnel-Proto
My graduation project is an action 3D-game with shooter elements for PC. The player controls a spaceship flying inside a tube. His task is to avoid obstacles and destroy enemies. The spaceship can be equipped with the various types of weapons, such as machine gun, rocket launcher and laser. As player progress through the game, new enemies, obstacles and weapons are unlocked. Different types of enemies have different behavior determined by their artificial intelligence.
